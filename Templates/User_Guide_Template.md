## ℹ️ About this guide

I created this user guide for **{Name of application}**, a {brief description}, to demonstrate a structured, task‑oriented approach that improves clarity and usability beyond the official documentation. It provides step‑by‑step instructions, logical workflows, and visuals that help users get up and running quickly.

Unlike the official {Name of application} documentation, this guide {state what is improved vs. official docs—e.g., task grouping by user workflow, separation of concepts from tasks, clearer visuals}.

I chose {Name of application} because it {why you chose it—e.g., open-source, modern UX, benefits from clearer docs}.

**What I focused on:**
- Task-first structure with purposeful visuals and clear headings
- Consistency and accessibility (plain English, descriptive alt text, logical navigation)
- Workflow organization that mirrors how users actually work

> [!NOTE]  
> This user guide is based on a real application and was created exclusively for portfolio purposes. Some content may be modified to showcase technical writing best practices and may not reflect the application’s current functionality. For accurate and up‑to‑date information, refer to the official documentation.
