## User Guide Review Checklist
Use this checklist to make sure that a user guide follows the defined style, structure and writing guidelines.

### Global User Guide Checklist

- [ ] Verify open source application disclaimer is at the top of the guide:

   :warning: **DISCLAIMER**  
This user guide is based on a real open-source application and was created exclusively for portfolio purposes. Some content has been modified to showcase technical writing best practices and might not represent the application’s current functionality. For accurate and up-to-date information, refer to the official project repository and documentation for the application.

- [ ] Verify Table of Contents comes after the disclaimer, and includes all accurate heading 1s in the guide.
      
- [ ] Verify that the Introduction to the application chapter includes an **Overview**, any other relevant concept topics, **Key features**, and **Target audience**.

- [ ] Verify that the Key features topic only includes a bulleted list of features, where the feature is summed up in a few words and bold, then colon (:), and then there's a detailed explanation of the feature. For example: **Collaborative real-time, rich text editor**: Work together with other users on the same pages in real time using a rich text editor.

- [ ] Verify that the **Target audience** topic has the following syntax: This guide is designed for users who {describe what the users need to do, their role, permissions, etc.}. For example: This guide is designed for users who want to create and share content in a wiki format and collaborate with other users.

- [ ] For all proprietary UI elements, make sure they are initial-capped.
      
- [ ] Review all graphics:
      
   - [ ] Confirm accessibility for all graphics - Alt Text is logical, in verb form if actionable.
         
   - [ ] Verify there's a --- and --- separating the graphic from text.
     
   - [ ] Make sure the graphic is visually appealing, complements the text, and adds to user comprehension.
