# Liz Marlowe - Technical Writing Portfolio
*Clear, user-focused documentation that simplifies complexity.*

Welcome! I'm **Liz Marlowe**, a Senior Content Developer specializing in crafting impactful user-centric documentation across diverse platforms.

## About me

With 20+ years of experience in technical content development, I craft clear, task-focused, accessible documentation that empowers users and accelerates product adoption. 

From writing feature descriptions for release notes to creating API guides from scratch, my goal is to simplify complex technology and help users accomplish tasks with confidence.

## 🗂 Planning & Process

Clear, thorough documentation starts with strong planning. 

Here's how I approach every content development project:

- **Content Strategy**: Define audience, goals, and scope before writing.
- **Information Architecture**: Organize content into task, concept, and reference topics into logical user workflows.
- **Tools**: Use templates, checklists, and version control for consistency

### Resources

I create and use specific [templates](https://github.com/LizMarlowe-byte/Tech-writing-portfolio/tree/main/Templates) for every content project I develop. Once I complete a first draft, I use [editing checklists](https://github.com/LizMarlowe-byte/Tech-writing-portfolio/blob/main/Editing_Checklists) to verify style, consistency, verbiage, and other writing guidelines. This structured approach ensures every deliverable is accurate, user-focused, and aligned with product goals.
