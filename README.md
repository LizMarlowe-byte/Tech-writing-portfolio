# Liz Marlowe - Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Liz Marlowe**, a Principal Technical Writer specializing in crafting impactful user-centric documentation across diverse platforms.

## About me

With 20+ years of experience in technical content development, I craft clear, task-focused, accessible documentation that empowers users and accelerates product adoption. From editing bug and feature descriptions for release notes to writing full complex integration guides from scratch, my goal is to simplify complex technology and help users accomplish tasks with confidence.

## 📖 Documentation Index

This portfolio showcases examples of my work, including different types of user guides, API documentation, knowledge base articles, technical reference guides, and release notes. Due to the proprietary nature of my work as a Principal Technical Writer, I cannot share the actual documentation I developed for my current or previous employers. Therefore, all samples in this portfolio are based on open-source projects or fictional applications, designed to showcase my writing style, structure, and technical communication skills.

> [!NOTE]
> The Knowledge Base articles provide tutorials for accomplishing specific tasks in real, publicly available applications. All content is my original work, created to address gaps in the existing documentation.
